            <h3>In The Beginning ...</h3>
            <p>
                <span class = "highlight">The history of computers starts out about 2000 years ago</span>, with the birth of the 
                <a href = "https://www.ecb.torontomu.ca/~elf/abacus/history.html"target = "_blank">abacus</a>. When the beads
                on the  are moved around, according to programming rules memorized by the user, all regular
                arithmetic problems can be done. In 1671, Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz invented a computer that was
                built in 1694. It could add, and, after changing some things around, multiply. About a century later
                Thomas of Colmar created the first successful mechanical calculator that could add, subtract, multiply,
                and divide.

        <h3>Other Memorable Events ...</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>In 1812, Babbage realized that many long calculations were really a series of predictable actions
                    that were constantly repeated. He began to design an automatic mechanical calculating machine,
                    which he <span class = "note">called a difference engine.</span></li>
                    <br />
                <li>Herman Hollerith and James Powers made a step towards automated computing with the
                    development of punched cards. Reading errors were reduced dramatically, workflow increased,
                    and stacks of punched cards could be used as memory of almost unlimited size. For more than 50
                    years, punched card machines did most of the world's first business computing.</li>
                    <br />
                <li>The start of <a href = "https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii"target = "_blank">World War II</a>
                     produced a large need for computer capacity. In 1942, John P. Eckert
                    and John W. Mauchly decided to build a high - speed electronic computer to do the job. Known
                    as ENIAC, this machine could multiply two numbers at a rate of 300 per second.</li>
                    <br />
                <li>Early in the 50's two important engineering discoveries changed the image of the computer field
                    - Magnetic Core Memory and Transistor - Circuit Elements. These technical discoveries quickly
                    found their way into computers. Such computers were mostly found in large computer centers
                    operated by industry, government, and private laboratories.</li>
            </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>In the 1960's, efforts to design and develop the fastest possible computer with the greatest
            capacity reached a turning point with the Stretch computer by IBM. Stretch was made with the
            fastest access time, and total capacity in the vicinity of 100,000,000 words.</li>
            <br />
        <li>Many companies, some new to the computer field, introduced programmable minicomputers
            supplied with software packages in the 1970's. The "shrinking" trend continued with the
            introduction of personal computers (PC's), which are programmable machines small enough and
            inexpensive enough to be purchased and used by individuals. Many companies, such as Apple
            Computer and Radio Shack introduced very successful PCs in the 1970's.</li>
            <br />
        <li>By the late 1980's, some personal computers were run by 
            <a href = "https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/microprocessor"target = "_blank">microprocessors</a> that, handling 32 bits
            of data at a time, could process about 4,000,000 instructions per second.</li>
            <br />
        <li>Computer networking, e-mail and the Internet, and electronic publishing are just a few of the
            applications that have grown in recent years. Computers continue to decrease in price, offering
            the promise that soon, “computers will reside in most homes, offices, and schools”.</li>

   <h3> HTML Features ...</h3>
   
   <details>
    <summary>Click Here for previous added features.</summary>
    </br>
    My first html feature of choice was "Details and Summary". The details tag creates a widget from which users can obtain additional 
    information. Inside it, the summary tag provides a clickable heading that toggles the visibility of the content within the
    details element. When the summary is clicked, it expands or collapses to show or hide the additional text on content places
    inside. 
    </details>

</br></br></br>

    <h3> CSS Features ...</h3>

    <p>The image zoom feature makes an image grow larger when you hover your mouse over it. The image is kept in a box that's 100 pixels
         wide and is centered on the page. It fits the box perfectly, so it looks good no matter the size. When you move your mouse over 
         the image, it smoothly enlarges to more than double its size over half a second, which catches the eye.
         This feature makes the image more interesting and fun to interact with!
    </p>
